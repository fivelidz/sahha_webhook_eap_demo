3. **Dashboard Pagination**: Test profiles appear on **page 5-6** of the dashboard (sorted alphabetically, "TestProfile" comes after "SampleProfile")

## How to View All Score Types:

### Option 1: Search for Test Profiles
1. Use the search box in the dashboard
2. Search for "TestProfile"
3. You'll see all score types displayed

### Option 2: Change Page Size
