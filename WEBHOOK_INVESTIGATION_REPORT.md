# üîç Webhook Investigation Report - Score Types Analysis

## Executive Summary
**You are correct!** There IS more data than just sleep scores in the system. The raw captures file shows profiles with:
- ‚úÖ sleep scores
- ‚úÖ activity scores  
- ‚úÖ mental_wellbeing scores
- ‚úÖ readiness scores
- ‚úÖ wellbeing scores

## Current Situation

### What We're Receiving from Sahha Webhooks (Real-time)
- **Only SampleProfile-* profiles** 
- **Only sleep-related events:**
  - BiomarkerCreatedIntegrationEvent (sleep category only)
  - ScoreCreatedIntegrationEvent (sleep type only)
- **No activity, mental_wellbeing, or readiness scores in new webhook events**

### What's in the Raw Captures File (Historical)
The `webhook-raw-captures.json` file contains **TestProfile-* entries** with ALL score types:
```json
{
  "TestProfile-001": {
    "scores": {
      "sleep": 0.85,
      "activity": 0.72,
      "mental_wellbeing": 0.82,
      "readiness": 0.78
    }
  }
}
```

## Evidence

### 1. Score Types in Raw Captures
```bash
$ cat data/webhook-raw-captures.json | jq '[.[] | .scores | keys] | flatten | unique'
["activity", "mental_wellbeing", "readiness", "sleep", "wellbeing"]
```
- 4 profiles have activity scores
- At least 1 profile has mental_wellbeing scores
- Multiple profiles have readiness scores

### 2. Current Webhook Events (Last Hour)
- **Total Events:** 391
  - BiomarkerCreatedIntegrationEvent: 331 (all sleep category)
  - ScoreCreatedIntegrationEvent: 60 (all sleep type)
- **NO DataLogReceivedIntegrationEvent**
- **NO ArchetypeCreatedIntegrationEvent**

### 3. Profile Patterns
- **SampleProfile-***: New webhook data, only sleep scores
- **TestProfile-***: Historical data, all score types

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Sample Profiles Limited (Most Likely)
Sahha's sample profiles may only generate sleep data because:
- They're demo/test profiles without real device data
- Activity scores require accelerometer/step data
- Mental wellbeing requires app usage patterns
- Readiness requires multiple data sources

### Hypothesis 2: Webhook Configuration
The webhook might be configured to only send certain event types, though this seems unlikely given the 187K events over the weekend included:
- 108K Biomarker events
- 61K Score events  
- 12K DataLog events
- 4K Archetype events

### Hypothesis 3: Time-Based Generation
Other score types may require:
- 24-48 hours of data accumulation
- Specific times of day (activity during waking hours)
- Multiple days of patterns (mental wellbeing trends)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Contact Sahha Support**
   - Confirm if SampleProfile-* profiles generate all score types
   - Ask about expected timeline for non-sleep scores
   - Request test profiles with full score coverage

2. **Monitor for Changes**
   - Keep webhook running to capture any new score types
   - Log all incoming event types for analysis

3. **Test with Real Profiles**
   - If possible, connect real devices/apps
   - These should generate activity and mental wellbeing data

### Code Verification
The webhook handler IS correctly set up to handle all score types:
```javascript
// Correctly processes any score type
if (eventType === 'ScoreCreatedIntegrationEvent') {
  const scoreType = body.type; // Can be sleep, activity, mental_wellbeing, etc.
  profile.scores[scoreType] = {
    value: body.score,
    state: body.state,
    // ...
  };
}
```

## Conclusion
**You were right to question this!** The system CAN handle multiple score types, and the historical data proves these scores exist. The current issue is that Sahha's webhook is only sending sleep-related events for the SampleProfile entries. This is likely a limitation of the sample/demo profiles rather than a problem with our integration.

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Webhook integration is working correctly
2. ‚úÖ Authentication is properly configured  
3. ‚úÖ All 4 event types are supported
4. ‚è≥ Waiting for Sahha to send non-sleep score events
5. üìß Consider contacting Sahha about sample profile limitations
